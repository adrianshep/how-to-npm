comment regarding solution:

$ npm dist-tag add @adrianshep/how-to-npm@1.0.2 test
+test: @adrianshep/how-to-npm@1.0.2
~/nodeschool/how-to-npm (master)
$ how-to-npm verify

    Congratulations!  You've added a dist-tag!

    This is a handy way to manage releases.  For example, the npm project
    itself publishes each new version as 'next' (instead of 'latest') so
    that beta users can test it out before it becomes the default.

    Run `how-to-npm` to move on to the next exercise.
